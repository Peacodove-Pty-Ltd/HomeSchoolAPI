How this project differs from others. Who is this for. What else do readers ned to know to understand this project.

Example

We want to make it very easy for employees who publish code to attract positive attention to their work. Some porjects are very complex, so we created an outline to help. This helps publishers gather the information in an organized way. This also helps those who browse our projects get the information they need to decide if this project is relevant to them, and if so, how to proceed. We ask employees who publish new open source projects to adapt these files to meet the needs of your project based on the Verizon Media Open Source Skeleton Specification.

Remember, if users can’t install this project, they will not contribute much to it. Assume they might need information about the programming language version or operating environment information. Don’t assume they operate under the same exact conditions we do internally.
